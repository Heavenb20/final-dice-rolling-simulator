# Dice Rolling Simulator

This program simulates a dice rolling game where each player rolls a die, and the player with the highest roll wins. The game also tracks the frequency of each dice face (1-6) and visualizes the results using a bar chart.

## Features:
- Players take turns rolling a six-sided die.
- The total time for all turns is tracked.
- A bar chart is generated showing the distribution of dice rolls.

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repository or download the `dice_simulator.py` file.
2. Run the program using the command: `python dice_simulator.py`.

## Special Features:
- **Seaborn Visualization**: A bar chart shows how often each die face appeared.
- **Timing Analysis**: The program tracks and displays how long the game took, and the time for each player's turn.
